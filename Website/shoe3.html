<h4>Nike Kobe 6 Protro Reverse Grinches</h4>
<h5>Description: </h5>
<p>The Nike Kobe 6 Protro Reverse Grinches (Kobe Bryants Shoe) are one of the, if not the most popular and successful basketball shoe ever released with its unique design and high skilled performance, just like how Kobe Bryant wanted it. The sneaker is built to be lightweight, responsive and supportive with its low cut design feature that allows players to exert rapid movements. This shoe is mainly worn by guards and forwards who shoot but still dunk and attack the rim a lot. The shoe is wrapped in bright red while the laces are neon green along with the logo on the bottom. The Kobe 6 Protro Reverse Grinches also have a design where the upper part of the shoe is wrapped in a special snakeskin-like texture due to Kobe Bryant's nickname being, 'Black Mamba' to honor his legacy and the dominant role he had in the NBA.</p>
<h5>Price: </h5>
<p>$537.90</p>
