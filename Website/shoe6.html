<h4>Curry 12</h4>
<h5>Description: </h5>
<p>The Curry 12's (Stephen Curry's Shoe) are built for players who rely on speed, footwork, shooting and balance just like Steph Curry. The shoe uses a special foam for cushioning called the UA Flow and this makes the shoe lightweight and have amazing grip. This gives a player more control and freedom on the court, making it easier for them to change direction or stop at an instance. The upper part of the shoe is made out of engineered mesh which makes the shoe feel light but still hold your feet in place. With added support such as the molded heel counter, it makes it much easier for you to accelerate when trying to get away from your defender. The Curry 12's also have a modern look to it with special color patterns and of course the Curry logo with its clean but effective design.</p>
<h5>Price: </h5>
<p>$239.00</p>
