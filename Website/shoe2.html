<h4>Nike Lebron 22</h4>
<h5>Description: </h5>
<p>The Nike Lebron 22 (Lebron James Shoe) is a combination of hard-core performance and premium design. This shoe has great stability and control, allowing you to drive into the rim and make the shot, matching Lebron's aggressive playstyle. The Lebron 22's are built to handle intensity and power so players can withstand pressure from the defence more easily. The sneaker also has a unique midfoot support feature where it basically locks your foot in place within the shoe. This prevent people from slipping and allows bigger players to put a lot of weight and force onto the shoe. This shoe also has good control when running up and down the court while being aggressive at the same time just like Lebron James.    </p>
<h5>Price: </h5>
<p>$260.00</p>
